find dev user for gitlab?
see if nvidia broadcast can be run as a service from a batch file on startup
add scripts to task scheduler: reupload after hours, folder watcher on user login
put batch files in main directory of project rather than in tools folder

suggestions for face filter:
make lists of filters based on position. randomly choose one from each of the lists (top of head, on face, on shoulder, on chest)
